Division spews bad information amp Fake News all over the globe This is why foreign leaders are always asking me Why does the Media hate the US sooo much It is a fraudulent shame amp all comes from the top Great news that an activist investor is now involved with ATampT As the owner of VEY LOW ATINGS CNN perhaps they will now put a stop to all of the Fake News emanating from its noncredible anchors Also I hear that because of its bad ratings it is losing a fortune As bad as CNN is Comcast MSNBC is worse Their ratings are also way down because they have lost all credibility I believe their stories about me are not  negative but actually  negative They are incapable of saying anything positive despite all of the great things that this Administration has done They dont talk about the great economy the big tax and regulation cuts the rebuilding of the Military Choice at our VA our Vets Judges and Supreme Court Justices the Border Wall going up lowest crime numbers nd A and so much more The Trump Administrations has achieved more in the first   years of its existence than perhaps any administration in the history of our Country We get ZEO media credit for what we have done

have  soon President Obama said that he did not have the right to sign DACA that it will never hold up in court He signed it anyway If the Supreme Court upholds DACA it gives the President extraordinary powers far greater than ever thought If they do what is right and do not let DACA stand with all of its negative legal implications theepublicans and Democrats will have a DEAL to let them stay in our Country in very short order It would actually benefit DACA and be done the right way So why is someone a good or great President if they needed to Spy on someone elses Campaign in order to win that didnt work out so well and if they were unable to fill  important Federal Judgeships a record by far handing them all to me to choose Will have  soon Only  percent want the President Impeached which is pretty low considering the volume of Fake News coverage but pretty high considering the fact that I did NOTHING wrong It is all just a continuation of the greatest Scam and Witch
